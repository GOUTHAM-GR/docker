Objectives:
    1. A cluster of 3 servers which will have 1 Manager and 2 worker nodes. These servers can either be on cloud such as AWS / GCP or local virtual machines. 
       The assumption is that you're using Ubuntu 16.04+ Operating System

    2. Make sure that the cluster is setup and configured properly including the Overlay network that would be set up by Docker swarm at the time of initialization.

    3. Deploy a simple nginx “service” with a replica set of 3 on the cluster to verify the integrity.
